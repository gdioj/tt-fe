/**
 * Testing the Enhanced DataTable Number Filtering
 * 
 * The issue was that number filters weren't working because:
 * 1. Column cells display formatted values (e.g., "₱250.00")
 * 2. Filter was trying to compare against raw numbers
 * 
 * SOLUTION:
 * Updated the numberRangeFilter to access row.original[columnId] instead of row.getValue(columnId)
 * This gets the raw unformatted number from the data source.
 * 
 * Example Data:
 * {
 *   uid: "1",
 *   first_name: "John",
 *   last_name: "Doe", 
 *   employment_date: "2023-01-15",
 *   daily_rate: 250.00  // <- Raw number value
 * }
 * 
 * Table Display: "₱250.00" (formatted)
 * Filter Comparison: 250.00 (raw value)
 * 
 * HOW TO TEST:
 * 1. Go to the employees page
 * 2. Select "Daily Rate (number)" from the filter dropdown
 * 3. Enter min/max values (e.g., Min: 200, Max: 300)
 * 4. Click "Add Filter"
 * 5. Verify that only employees with daily rates between 200-300 are shown
 * 
 * The debug console.log will show the actual values being compared:
 * "Filtering daily_rate: 250 against range [200, 300]"

// Test data example for verification
const testEmployee = {
  uid: "1",
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Doe",
  employment_date: "2023-01-15",
  daily_rate: 275.50
};

// Filter test
const filterValue = "200:350"; // Min: 200, Max: 350
const [min, max] = filterValue.split(':').map(v => v === '' ? undefined : parseFloat(v));
const cellValue = testEmployee.daily_rate;

const shouldShow = (min === undefined || cellValue >= min) && 
                   (max === undefined || cellValue <= max);

console.log(`Employee with rate ${cellValue} should ${shouldShow ? 'be shown' : 'be hidden'} for range [${min}, ${max}]`);

export {};
